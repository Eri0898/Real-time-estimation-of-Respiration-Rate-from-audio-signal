# Real-time-estimation-of-Respiration-Rate-from-audio-signal

- In the [Matlab algorithm]() a Matlab script for the estimation of the Respiration Rate from audio respiratory signals is implemented. In this script the Respiration Rate is simply counted by loading the respiratory signal, filtering it and counting its peaks.
